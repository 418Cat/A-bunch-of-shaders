# Shaders
Shaders are programs running on the GPU. The programming style is very different from typical programming,
as on shadertoy the code is ran for each pixel (This type of shaders is called Fragment Shaders).
Shadertoy allows for fragment shaders to be written and ran in a browser thanks to WebGL.

## What is this ?
This repository is a collection of shaders I have written for shadertoy. The shaders are pretty simple and are made purely out of curiosity as POCs.
<br>
Shaders are sorted in the `./3D` and `./2D` folders depending on the type of scene they represent.

## List of all shaders in this repo:
- 2D:
  - Quadtree visualizer
  - Function visualizer
- 3D:
  - Very simple ray tracer

### To check them out, the shaders can be found on my Shadertoy profile: [www.shadertoy.com/user/418cat](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/418cat)
