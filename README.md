# Shaders
Shaders are programs running on the GPU. The programming style is very different from typical programming,
as on shadertoy the code is ran for each pixel (This type of shaders is called Fragment Shaders).
Shadertoy allows for fragment shaders to be written and ran in a browser thanks to WebGL.

## What is this ?
This repository is a collection of shaders I have written for shadertoy. The shaders are pretty simple and are made purely out of curiosity as POCs.
<br>
Shaders are sorted in the `./3D` and `./2D` folders depending on the type of scene they represent.

## This repo's shaders list:
- 2D:
  - ####[Quadtree visualizer](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4X3BRr)
 &emsp; Moving the mouse changes how the quadtree is built
<br>

  - ####[Function visualizer](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XfVcz3)
&emsp; Displays 2D real functions with a bunch of options
<br>

  - ####[FPS Graph](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/X3tBWr)
&emsp; A configurable & easy to integrate shader to show the scene's performance history
<br>
- 3D:
  - ####[Very simple ray tracer](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/M3KcRw)
&emsp; A basic ray tracer wrote in a few hours after reading the great [Ray tracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html)
